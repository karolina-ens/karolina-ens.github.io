<p> Karagandy is a well-known city in Kazakhstan which was founded in 1934.
    There is a legend behind the foundation of the city which says that there once was a young shepard
    who found an interesting black rock that had unusual properties and butnt bright in the fire.
    The rock turned out to be coal, and Karagandy became a large coal-mining cite which still has 
    multiple functioning mines and coal production.

<br>
<p> Nowadays, Karagandy has grown to become a large city. Personally, what I like most about Karagandy 
    is the people who live there. Even though the city is mostly industrial, there are lots of creative people.
    There are numerous museums, parks, art galleries, and other leisure activities.
